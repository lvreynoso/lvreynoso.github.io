## This is a test document

I am writing this on a Macbook Pro 14-inch laptop at the Apple Store at Union Square in San Francisco, CA. I am here to test the physical differences between
a 14 inch and 16 inch laptop. I really like my current Macbook Pro's size, but since I plan on traveling and doing the whole digital nomad thing it might be worth
it to get a smaller computer that is lighter and more portable.

This 14 inch computer is certainly light enough. The keyboard is surprisingly big and feels full sized enough, even on this small computer. I find myself reaching
for the delete key and accidentally press the equals sign instead. Perhaps my hands are smaller than I perceive them to be. This keyboard certainly seems big enough
for me. I am looking at the difference between the jeyboards on the two laptops and I honestly cannot see much of a difference. The speakers on this laptop seem
smaller but that doesn't bother me at all because if I'm listening to any audio on my computer it's going to be through headphones.

I am now going to try doing this same thing in the 16 inch computer.
